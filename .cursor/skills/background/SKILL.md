# Overview

Insert overview text here. The agent will only see this should they choose to apply the rule.

## read docs before implementing, and update related documents if you changed the actual implementations.

- Architecture: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

## use good third party library in priority

- do not add poor implementation if we can choose good quality libs.

## bring high qualify implementation

- code with low architecture design is never acceptable!
- always respect module/system design when implement new feature under certain scope.
