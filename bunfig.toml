# Code splitting configuration
# Note: Bun's code splitting (--splitting) only works effectively with MULTIPLE entrypoints.
# For single entrypoint builds, all dependencies are bundled into one file.
# To enable code splitting, you need to:
# 1. Use multiple entrypoints in build command: bun build entry1.ts entry2.ts --splitting
# 2. Use dynamic imports (import()) in your code to create separate chunks
# 3. For server-side apps, single-file bundles are often acceptable and simpler to deploy
